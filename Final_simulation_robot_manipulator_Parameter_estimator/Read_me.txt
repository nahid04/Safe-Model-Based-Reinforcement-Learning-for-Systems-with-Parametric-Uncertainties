Model-based reinforcement learning for systems with parametric uncertainites

For four state systems/ robot manipulator

Run

1. Run main_BF_FCL_final_manipulator.m to generate datamat files. 
2. Run GPOPS_comparison_preSim.m then GPOPS_comparison.m to generate 
   GPOPS comparison resultsmat files. 
3. Use Plot_needed_Frontiers_manipulator.m to generate plots for the ACC submission. 


To customize markers  f_nummarkers.m has been used. 

Do not delete any code. 

Necessary notations are provided in the mainbody of the code, the mathematics
can be found in arXiv:2007.12666.
