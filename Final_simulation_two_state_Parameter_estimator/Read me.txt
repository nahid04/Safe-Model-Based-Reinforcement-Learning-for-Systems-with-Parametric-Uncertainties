"Model-based reinforcement learning for systems with parametric uncertainites"

For two state systems

Run

1. Run main_BF_FCL_final.m to generate data/mat files. 
2. Run GPOPS_comparison_preSim.m then GPOPS_comparison.m to generate 
   GPOPS comparison results/mat files. 
3. Use Plot_needed_Frontiers_two_states.m to generate plots for the ACC submission. 


To customize markers:  f_nummarkers.m has been used. 

Necessary notations are provided in the mainbody of the code, the mathematics
can be found in arXiv:2007.12666.

%% This code presents a four-state dynamical system for the parameter estimation
%% This system represents a robot manipulator.
%% The notations are similar to the mentioned paper. 
%% Transformed system denotes the system we have after applying the barrier transformation to the original system.
%% In this document, x is the original state of the system, s is the original state of the transformed system.
